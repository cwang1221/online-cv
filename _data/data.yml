    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I've been working in SAP as a Frontend Developer for 5 years. 
      Besides daily development, I also take the role of Frontend Architect 
      for the whole product. This requests me to take high-level topics like 
      UI strategy, UI integration, UI test automation improvement and etc. 
      I'm also the UX Advocate in my team to guide my colleagues on UX related topics.

education:
    - degree: MSc in Information Technology
      university: Technical University of Braunschweig (Technische UniversitÃ¤t Braunschweig)
      time: 2012 - 2016

    - degree: BSc in Telecommunication Engineering
      university: Xidian University
      time: 2008 - 2012

experiences:
    - role: SAP S/4HANA Subscription Billing - Frontend Developer
      time: 2016 - Present
      company: SAP, Chengdu, China
      details: |
        - (**Team level**) Led the UI development of 5 applications (Business Configuration, Customer, Product, Side Navigation and Allowance Template),
        including draft mockup design and implementation. These 5 applications have the best performance and the fewest bug in the whole product.
        - (Product level) Led the migration from classic Launchpad to Side Navigation, to fulfill the UI Consistency Guideline of C/4HANA. The task was 
        complex and urgent, but I completed it in time with some additional nice features, such as new home page and back navigation support.
        - (Product level) Led the UI Integration between Subscription Billing and S/4HANA Core. In this task I collaborated closely with experts 
        outside our product, to achieve the integration of two totally different infrastructures.
        - (Product level) Led the UI quality enhancement, including UI test automation and coding convention. The results are:
          - All teams migrated to better test automation frameworks.
          - All teams followed the guideline to organise the automaion test cases. 
          - All teams learnt from our practice to design the coding convention based on ESLint. Feedbacks are positive, like
          more stable test automation, less bugs and better code readability.
